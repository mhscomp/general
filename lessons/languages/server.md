#MHS Robotics Club: Languages#

<b>Java</b><br/>
One of the most popular programming languages, it can be run on servers and to make desktop applications that (theoretically) run on all desktops.

Java is most often used by companies with extremely high traffic, such as Amazon and the Apple App Store. If you're not sure about which language to learn, Java is a safe bet.

<b>Javascript (Node.js)</b><br/>
Javascript is typically thought of as a client-side language, but now, with the development of Node.js, can be used on a server.

This means that you can run Javascript on your computer. It saves the hassle of having to learn 2 different languages for server and client side code. However, server-side javascript is still being developed.

<b>C</b><br/>
Is is a "bare bones" language, and is very flexible and customizable. In addition, it is often used to program hardware, and is easy to learn. 

However, it is not object oriented. In Javascript, for example, you can make a `person` object which can have properties such as "name" or "age". 

It also lacks many concepts found in other languages. C++ was built to fix these holes.

<b>C++</b><br/>
C++ can be used to write desktop applications, and is very fast. It is great for writing operating systems, drivers, and code for hardware.

<b>PHP</b><br/>
PHP is by far the most used server-side programming language. It's a little bit different than the rest, and can also be integrated into html like this:

```phtml
<h6>Hello, my name is:</h6>

<h6>
    <?php
        $name = "Michael"; //a variable
        echo($name); //will output $name HERE
    ?>
</h6>
```

Which will result in:

```
Hello, my name is:
Michael
```

When viewed in a browser. PHP can also be used to interact with client side code. Companies like Amazon will use it to keep track of things in your shopping cart, and Facebook will synchronize your chat messages.

<b>Python</b><br/>
Python focuses on readability, and using as few lines of code as possible. For example, if you want to import a library:

```python
import "something"

#that's it!
```

No semicolons are necessary, and instead of `{}`, tabs are used. This means that this:

```python
#testing 1
    #testing 2
```

is not the same as:

```python
#testing 1
#testing 2
```

<b>Ruby</b><br/>
Ruby, which can run on a server (Ruby on Rails), is also aimed at readability and minimizing the number of lines needed. Like Java, it is often used by companies with high traffic, such as Twitter.

<b>Perl</b><br/>
Older than the internet itself, Perl is a mature language that might take you a while to learn, but can be very useful.

It is a multipurpose language, and is used in everything from managing user data to combing through sequenced DNA data.

<blockquote>
Perl is very good at juggling pieces of text from various sources and combining them to form complete documents (sitepoint.com)
</blockquote>

Perl also has many ways to do the same task, and is better suited to low-usage servers.

<b>ASP</b><br/>
Microsoft <b>A</b>chive <b>S</b>erver <b>P</b>ages is NOT a language. Rather, it is: 

<blockquote>a framework that lets you combine one of a number of scripting languages (VBScript and JavaScript being the most popular choices) (sitepoint.com)
</blockquote>

It's useful for Microsoft diehards, but it's not free, and can be difficult to work with if you're used to a language such as Java or C.
