#MHS Robotics Club: Problem 2#

>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
>`1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...`
>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Here we'll want to continually sum the numbers until the value of the number we're adding on is over 4,000,000

**Javascript**
```javascript
var prev = 1; //the previous value
var current = 1; //the current value

//we need both because term 3 will be caluclated by adding prev + current
//then prev will become current. If it sounds confusing, just look at the code

var total = 0;
while(current <= 4000000){
	if(current % 2 === 0){
		//if even, add it on
		
		total += current;
	}
	
	//get the next number in the sequence
	var temp = current; //a temporary holder
	current = prev + current;
	prev = temp;
}

console.log(total);
```

`4613732 found in 44ms`

**Python**
```python
prev = 1 #previous value
current = 1 #current value

#you'll need both of these to calculate the next value in the series

total = 0
while current <= 4000000:
	if current % 2 == 0:
		total += current
	
	temp = current
	current = current + prev
	prev = temp

print total
```

`4613732 found in 15ms`
