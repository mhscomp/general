#MHS Robotics Club: Problem 1#

>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

This one is very simple. Just cycle through all of the numbers between 1 and 1000 (not including 1000) and see which ones are divisible by 3 or 5.

**Javascript**
```javascript
var total = 0; //totals the sum

for(var i = 1; i < 1000; i++){
	//goes through every integer between 1 and 1000
	//doesn't include 1000 because of the "<"
	
	if(i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0){
		//if the remainder when dividing by 3 is 0
		//or if the remainer when dividing by 5 is 0
		
		// % = modulo or remaineder
		// || = "or"
		
		total += i; //equivilant to: total = total + i;
	}
}

console.log(total);
```
