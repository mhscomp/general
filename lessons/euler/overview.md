#MHS Robotics Club: Project Euler#

**Overview**<br/>
Project Euler is a website in which you answer math problems using code.

Here's the basic way it works:
1. You get a problem
2. You write the code
3. You run the code to get the answer
4. You submit the answer

Most of the problems include some heavy computations that would be nearly impossible without the aid of a computer. 

It's best to solve the problems with whatever language you're comfortable with.
