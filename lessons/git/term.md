#MHS Robotics Club: GIT#

Before you start using git, there are some terms that you should know.

<b>Repository</b></br>
A repository, or "repo," is contains a git-based project. All of the files are contained within the repository. It is, in a sense, the "top-most" folder containing your project files.

<b>Clone</b></br>
Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of a git repository. Any changes made to the cloned copy will NOT be made to the remote repository unless you `commit` and `push` the changes (more on that later).

<b>Commit</b></br>
Commiting changes means finalizing the changes to the file. This, in conjunction with `push` will change the remote repository.

<b>Push</b></br>
When you push the local copy of a clone repository, it will take all of the local commited changes and apply them to the remote repository.
