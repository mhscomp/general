#MHS Robotics Club: GIT#

<b>Overview</b><br/>
Git is a protocol for collaborating on code and keeping it neet and organized. It allows you to see who made changes to a specific file, to the changes themselves, and, if need be, to revert the file back to a previous version.

It's like a history of the changes made to any given file.

For example, I once made the mistake of deleting this very file from the git repository, losing the content. So, I went back through the commit history until I found what I had deleted, and created a new file indentical to the one I had deleted.
