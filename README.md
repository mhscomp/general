###What We'll Do###
It's important to know that this is mostly student-run, so projects and flexible. Our course of action is determined by the members.

Requires more programming knowledge. Basic knowledge of Java is helpful.

####Computer Science Help####
Taking _AP Computer Science_ or _Programming in C_? We can help you prepare and practice for your classes.

####ACSL Competition####
This requires some programming knowledge. If you have some, great! Otherwise, we'll train you.

####Program a robot####
The primary focus. This includes block-based programming (no experience necessary) and language-based programming (using a programming language).

####CS Education week####
Raise awareness for computer science education.

####Web Server####
Turn your computer into a server, or set up a remote server for free and maintain a website.
