#MHS Robotics Club: GIT#

<b>Overview</b><br/>
Git is a protocol for collaborating on code and keeping it neet and organized. It allows you to see who made changes to a specific file, to the changes themselves, and, if need be, to revert the file back to a previous version.

It's like a history of the changes made to any given file.

For installation help, go <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">here</a>

<b>Installation: Mac</b><br/>

<ol>
	<li>Install XCode (it's a very large file) from the Mac App store</li>
	<li>Download and install <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/mac">Git</a></li>
</ol>

Then, open the "Terminal" app that comes on your mac and try entering 

```
git --version
```
if you see a number, you're good to go.

<b>Installation: Windows</b><br/>

<ol>
	<li>Go <a href="http://git-scm.com/download">here</a></li>
	<li>Click on "windows"</li>
</ol>

After the installation, open the command prompt, and try entering

```
git --version
```
if you see a number, you're good to go.

<b>Installation: Linux</b></br>

Go to <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/linux">this</a> site. It has instructions for various versions of Linux.

Once installed, try opening a command line window and entering

```
git --version
```
if you see a number, you're good to go.

<b>Setting up Github</b></br>
If you already have a github account, skip this step. Otherwise, go to <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> and create an account. It's free.

<b>Configuring git</b></br>
Open up a new terminal/command prompt window. 

Enter your name and email:

```
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
```

```
git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
```

Then, follow <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys#platform-all">these instructions</a>. They are specific to your platform (Mac/Windows/Linux).
