<b>See if Git is installed</b><br/>
See if your computer already has Git installed by running the `git` command:

```bash
$ git
```


If you see a readout of a bunch of commands, it means Git is installed. In that case, go <a href="config.md">here</a>

*Git is installed:*

If, however, you see an error telling you the command `git` is not recognized or not found, you'll need to install Git.

*Git is not installed*:

<b>Download and install Git</b><br/>
If Git was *not* yet installed, head to the [download page](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and choose your operating system. 

Download the program and run through installation.

Once installation is complete, close and re-open your CL shell.

Now, try the `git` command again. If there is an output, you're good to go.
