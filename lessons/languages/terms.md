<b>Server</b><br/>
A server is simply a computer (as opposed to a web browser). This can be your own computer, or a remote one.

<b>Server-side</b><br/>
Server side code runs on a server, and can be used to coordinate the actions of many clients (users). For example, Facebook's servers may use PHP (a server-side language) to coordinate the chats of many different users on many different web browsers. Server-side langauges preform much of the "grunt work" and are used to mangage databases.

An important thing to note is that users cannot edit or see server-side code. This helps to prevent hackers from finding out how your code works, or from changing your databases. Server-side scripts can communicate with client-side code using a variety of methods.

Server-side langauges include C++, Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby on Rails.

<b>Client-side</b><br/>
Client-side code runs in a web browser. It's typically supposed to be faster and smaller than server-side code, as it has to re-run whenever a page is refreshed. It doesn't store anything permenant.

Client-side code can request information from a server, and can also recieve responses.

The main client-side language is Javascript.

A good post explaining the differences between client and server side code is located <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/171203/what-are-the-difference-between-server-side-and-client-side-programming">here</a>.

<b>Database</b><br/>
Think of it as an Excel spreadsheet that can be read and edited by server-side code.

<b>HTTP</b><br/>
HTTP is a protocol with which client and server side code can communicate. Think of browsers and servers are people. If the data is <i>what</i> there're saying, HTTP is <i>speech itself</i>. It's how the data is transfered.
