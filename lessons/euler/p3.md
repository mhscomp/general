>The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
>What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

Now, thing get interesting. You'll be dealing with primes a lot in these problems, so get used to them. It's useful to not that to get all of the factors of `n` you only need to go up to `n/2` rounded up.

We'll do this using the method usually used when finding factors by hand. Start with the smallest factors, then whittle it down.

```
(p) = prime
24
2(p) * 12
2(p) * 2(p) * 6
2(p) * 2(p) * 2(p) * 3(p)
```

**Javascript**
```javascript
var max = 0;

function factor(num){
	var top = Math.ceil(num/2); //this is the maximum needed
	
	for(var i = 2; i <= top; i++){
		if(num % i === 0 && num !== i){ //if divisible, but not equal (doesn't count as a factor)
			/*
			it is okay to treat i as a prime number, because it will always come across a prime factor before a non-prime one.
			
			Think about it...which will come first 2 or 4?
			Since there is a return statement, it will stop as soon as it finds a prime factor, then call itself again with what's left over
			*/
			if(i > max){
				max = i;
				console.log(max);
			}
			
			factor(num/i); //check what's left over
			return;
		}
	}
	
	//if return is not called, it must just be a prime number left over
	if(num > max){
		max = num;
		console.log(max);
	}
}

factor(600851475143);
```

```

Since `6857` is the largest, it is the answer.

```

`4613732 found in 15ms`
