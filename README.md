###What We'll Do###
It's important to know that this is mostly student-run, so projects and flexible. Our course of action is determined by the members.

<b>Android Programming</b></br>
Requires more programming knowledge. Basic knowledge of Java is helpful.

<b>Computer Science Help</b></br>
Taking <i>AP Computer Science</i> or <i>Programming in C</i>? We can help you prepare and practice for your classes.

<b>ACSL Competition</b><br/>
This requires some programming knowledge. If you have some, great! Otherwise, we'll train you.

<b>Program a robot</b><br/>
The primary focus. This includes block-based programming (no experience necessary) and language-based programming (using a programming language).

<b>CS Education week</b><br/>
Raise awareness for computer science education.

<b>Web Server</b><br/>
Turn your computer into a server, or set up a remote server for free and maintain a website.

<b>Seniors education</b><br/>
Run a computer literacy course for elders. Helps the community, and looks good on a college application.
