#MHS Robotics Club: OpenShift#

<b>Overview</b><br/>
OpenShift is a platform with which you can host a website for free. It will have a url in the form of `something.rhcloud.com`. 

Unlike other free hosting services, you have a great deal of control regarding the server, and can add "catridges" such as `php` and `mysql`.
