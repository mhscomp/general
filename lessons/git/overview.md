#MHS Robotics Club: GIT#

<b>Overview</b><br/>
Git is a protocol for collaborating on code and keeping it neet and organized. It allows you to see who made changes to a specific file, to the changes themselves, and, if need be, to revert the file back to a previous version.

It's like a history of the changes made to any given file.
