<b>Basic Skeleton</b><br/>
Your java file will be named something like `MyFile.java`. The basic "skeleton" of the file should look like this:

```java
public class MyFile {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
	}
}
```

In this case, the file is named `MyFile.java`. If it was instead named `test.java`. The file will begin with `public class test`. More on this later (much later). 

<b>Main functions</b><br/>
The `main` function is executed once this file loads. It's where the code that you want executed right away should be stored.
